# Written Report
- 1. Provide an overview of the organization (real or imaginary) for which you want to develop the application. (e.g., a University

  The organization that we are choosing to develop an application for is Marquette
University. Marquette University is a well-known private research college in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin. It has an extremely rich history, starting with a Society of Jesus (Jesuits) in 1881,
over 140 years ago. Back then and even now, Marquette is devoted to gathering a group of
students who show academic excellence, serve the community, and pursues the truth in all
aspects. The overall mission of this university is to be deeply rooted in Catholicism, Jesuit
traditions, and the education of the whole person.
Furthermore, Marquette's mission is to provide each student with a rigorous
educational experience so that they are prepared to make positive contributions outside of the
university. With a growing diverse student body, Marquette aims to attract a broader range of
cultures, backgrounds, and perspectives on life itself. This inclusivity, Marquette hopes to
foster a group of people who will reach their full potential with the support and help of others
from these different angles of life.
In addition, Marquette University offers its student body a comprehensive range of
disciplines, including liberal arts, sciences, business, engineering, health sciences,
communication, and the arts. These disciplines are presented to various undergraduate,
graduate, and professional programs. These academic offerings are complemented by
research initiatives, experiential learning opportunities, and a lively campus life enriched by
extracurricular activities, service projects, and cultural events.
As Marquette continues to value its tradition of excellence and innovation, it
recognizes the significance of technology on the overall student experience. With this, an
application for scheduling appointments with advisors caters to Marquette's commitment to
student success, access to resources, and promoting convenience on campus.

- 2. Provide an overview of the information systems employees, customers, and suppliers use to interact with the organization.

One information system students and faculty use to interact with the organization is
"CheckMarq." CheckMarq is a central hub (student information system) for managing
student data, academic records, course registration, financial aid, and billing information.
This system allows students to enroll in classes, view grades, access transcripts, and manage
their financial accounts. Regarding faculty, they can use the system to track student progress,
communicate with advisees, and submit grades.
Another information system that students and faculty use to interact with the
organization is"D2L." It is similar to learning management systems like Canvas or
Blackboard. It helps with online course delivery, collaboration, assessment, etc. On D2L, it
allows instructors to create course materials, post assignments, conduct discussions, and
administer quizzes and exams. This allows students to engage with course content, interact
with peers, submit assignments, and receive feedback through the platform.
Lastly, the information system that students use to interact with the organization
regarding move-in and move-out of dorms is"SignUpGenius." It is a dorm management
system that tracks times that students can move in and out of their dorms. However,
Marquette did not make the platform; Marquette faculty just used it as a scheduling tool. We
believe a more sophisticated tool, facilitated by Marquette, would be helpful for the students
and the parents involved

- 3. Choose an information system that you wish to work on (e.g., library management system). Explain in which way the chosen information system benefits the organization
 
  The information system we are choosing to work on is the student information
system. We chose this information system because having contact with your advisor
throughout your college career is extremely important. We are aware that in CheckMarq,
there is a section where the student is provided the name, college, room, and email of their
advisor. However, there is nothing provided to schedule a meeting with your advisor. The
student must either call the advising office of their college or email their advisor to set up an
appointment.
We are also aware that sometimes if the student emails their advisor, the advisor will
provide a separate link to a scheduling tool. However, a tool should be in the heart of the
advising tab so students can choose the day, time, and advisor they would like. During busier
seasons like fall or spring class registration, the student's primary advisors become extremely
busy. So, having a selection of advisors in their college and times that work would be a
helpful tool.

- 4. 

1. Divide your group members into two subgroups: (1) analysts and (2) business representatives
   
2. Watch the practice videos in Table 1 (these videos are your learning materials). Similar to the videos
you watched, record a video in which analysts talk with business representatives and
extract/translate business requirements to class diagrams
