  The organization that we are choosing to develop an application for is Marquette
University. Marquette University is a well-known private research college in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin. It has an extremely rich history, starting with a Society of Jesus (Jesuits) in 1881,
over 140 years ago. Back then and even now, Marquette is devoted to gathering a group of
students who show academic excellence, serve the community, and pursues the truth in all
aspects. The overall mission of this university is to be deeply rooted in Catholicism, Jesuit
traditions, and the education of the whole person.
Furthermore, Marquette's mission is to provide each student with a rigorous
educational experience so that they are prepared to make positive contributions outside of the
university. With a growing diverse student body, Marquette aims to attract a broader range of
cultures, backgrounds, and perspectives on life itself. This inclusivity, Marquette hopes to
foster a group of people who will reach their full potential with the support and help of others
from these different angles of life.
In addition, Marquette University offers its student body a comprehensive range of
disciplines, including liberal arts, sciences, business, engineering, health sciences,
communication, and the arts. These disciplines are presented to various undergraduate,
graduate, and professional programs. These academic offerings are complemented by
research initiatives, experiential learning opportunities, and a lively campus life enriched by
extracurricular activities, service projects, and cultural events.
As Marquette continues to value its tradition of excellence and innovation, it
recognizes the significance of technology on the overall student experience. With this, an
application for scheduling appointments with advisors caters to Marquette's commitment to
student success, access to resources, and promoting convenience on campus.
